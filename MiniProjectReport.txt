# Library Management System

## 1. Project Overview

The **Library Management System** is a console-based Python application developed using **Python** and **SQLite3**. The system automates common library operations such as member registration, book management, issuing and returning books, fine calculation, and book requests. It supports two roles: **Admin** and **Member (Teacher/Student)**.

This project is designed as a **mini-project** for academic purposes and follows proper database normalization, exception handling, and modular programming practices.

## 2. Objectives

* To manage library books efficiently
* To maintain member and admin records
* To automate book issue, return, and fine calculation
* To restrict members to a maximum of 3 issued books
* To block book requests if unpaid fine exceeds ₹300
* To provide genre-based book search

---

## 3. Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3
* **Database:** SQLite3
* **Libraries Used:**

  * `sqlite3` – database operations
  * `datetime` – date and fine calculations
  * `tabulate` – formatted table display

## 4. User Roles

### Admin

* Add, edit, delete books
* View all members
* View and approve book requests
* Issue books
* View fine details of all members

### Member (Teacher / Student)

* Register and login
* View available books
* Search books by title or genre
* Request books
* View issued books
* Return books
* View and pay fines
* View Available Genre
* View Available Books in a particular genre

```

**Relationships:**

* One Member can issue many Books
* One Book can be issued many times
* One Issue record can have one Fine
* One Member can make many Book Requests

---

## 7. Business Rules Implemented

* Maximum 3 books can be issued to a member at a time
* Fine is calculated at ₹10 per day after due date
* Book request is rejected if unpaid fine exceeds ₹300
* Available copies are automatically updated on issue/return

---

## 8. Exception Handling

* Database errors handled using `try-except`
* Invalid inputs handled gracefully
* Prevents duplicate admin insertion

---

## 9. Conclusion

This Library Management System successfully automates essential library functions using Python and SQLite. It demonstrates effective use of database design, exception handling, and role-based access. The project is scalable and can be enhanced further with a GUI or web interface.
